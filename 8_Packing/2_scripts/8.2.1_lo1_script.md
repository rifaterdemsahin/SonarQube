# Video 1 : Module 1 
## Decription - Introduction to SonarQube and Setting Up the Environment

**SPEAKER NOTES**:

---

**Slide 1 - Intro**

"Hello and welcome to the first module of our course titled, 'Code Quality With SonarQube'. In this course, we'll be uncovering the potential of SonarQube to improve code quality, ensuring your applications are more maintainable, reliable, and secure."

---

**Slide 2 - About this module**

"In this module, we will start with an introduction to SonarQube. And then, we'll help you set up the environment to get started with SonarQube."

---

**Slide 3 - What is SonarQube**

"So, what is SonarQube? SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous analysis of code quality. It can be used to automate code review, detect bugs and vulnerabilities, and provide reports on trends and quality gates."

---

**Slide 4 - Benefits of SonarQube**

"Why use SonarQube? It brings numerous benefits. For example:
  - It provides a comprehensive view of your code quality.
  - It supports more than 25 programming languages.
  - It can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous code quality checking.
  - And importantly, it helps you maintain a standard of code quality within your development team."

---

**Slide 5 - Setting up the Environment**

"Let's now focus on setting up the environment for SonarQube. First, you need to download and install SonarQube. You can download SonarQube from their official website. SonarQube is available in various editions. However, the Community Edition is sufficient for most developers, and it's free. Once the download is complete, extract the zip file. There, you'll find a directory named 'bin'. Inside it, you'll find the script files to start SonarQube."

**Demonstration Slide - Setting up Environment (optional)**

"Once you've carried out these instructions and started SonarQube, just open a web browser and enter 'localhost:9000'. This should open the SonarQube dashboard. If everything worked correctly, congratulations, you've set up your SonarQube environment!"

---

**Slide 6 - Summary**

"To summarize, we've covered the important concept of what SonarQube is, looked at its benefits, and walked through the process of setting up the SonarQube environment. Hopefully, you should now understand how valuable SonarQube can be in maintaining and improving code quality."

---

**Slide 7 - Next Steps**

"Great job on completing this first module. In the next module, we'll dive deeper into working with SonarQube, understanding the interface, and carrying out the initial code analysis tasks. So, stay tuned and keep working on improving the code quality with SonarQube!”

# Video 2: Setting Up SonarQube with Minikube

## Introduction (30s)
Welcome back! In this video, we'll set up SonarQube using Minikube in a development environment. We'll configure the essential components to get your code quality analysis platform running.

## Prerequisites Check (30s)
Before we begin, ensure you have:
- Minikube installed
- kubectl configured
- 4GB RAM available
- Docker running

## Main Content (3m)

### 1. Starting Minikube (45s)
Let's start by configuring our Minikube cluster:
```bash
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=2 --memory=4096MB --kubernetes-version=stable
```
This creates a cluster with sufficient resources for SonarQube.

### 2. Configuring Environment (45s)
First, create a namespace and storage:
```bash
kubectl create namespace sonarqube
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
```

### 3. Deploying Components (45s)
Deploy PostgreSQL and SonarQube:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment_postgresql.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment_server.yaml
```

### 4. Accessing SonarQube (45s)
Enable access through port forwarding:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n sonarqube svc/sonarqube 9000:9000
```

## Knowledge Check (30s)
> Which command verifies if your SonarQube pods are running correctly?
> a) kubectl get pods
> b) kubectl get pods -n sonarqube
> c) minikube status
> d) kubectl status
> (Answer: b) kubectl get pods -n sonarqube)

## Additional Resources (30s)
For detailed configuration options, visit the official SonarQube Kubernetes deployment guide at:
https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup-and-upgrade/deploy-on-kubernetes/

## Summary
You've now set up a working SonarQube instance in your development environment using Minikube. In our next video, we'll explore how to analyze your first project.

This script focuses on practical setup steps while maintaining engagement through clear instructions and a relevant knowledge check. It aligns with the learning objective of setting up SonarQube in a development environment and achieves the key result of configuring Minikube and SonarQube.This script focuses on practical setup steps while maintaining engagement through clear instructions and a relevant knowledge check.

# Video 3: Integrating GitHub with SonarQube

## Introduction (30s)
Welcome back! In this video, we'll connect GitHub with SonarQube to enable automated code analysis. We'll set up a GitHub App and configure our first repository scan.

## Prerequisites Check (30s)
Before we begin, ensure you have:
- SonarQube running (from previous video)
- GitHub account with admin access
- Repository to analyze
- Access to GitHub Actions

## Main Content (3m)

### 1. Creating GitHub Secrets (45s)
First, let's set up authentication:
- Go to your GitHub repository settings
- Navigate to Secrets and Variables > Actions
- Create two new secrets:
  ```bash
  SONAR_TOKEN=<your-token>
  SONAR_HOST_URL=<your-sonarqube-url>
