## Hands On Learning

- Overview: Hands on learning assignment 

- Prompt: Create a capstone project based on the code base

### Output 

### **Hands-On Learning**  
**Overview**: Capstone project to apply SonarQube analysis in a real-world scenario.  

**Prompt**: *"Create a capstone project based on the codebase"*  

**Output**:  
**Project Title**: **"Technical Debt Reduction Sprint"**  
**Steps**:  
1. **Setup**:  
   - Install SonarQube locally or use a cloud instance.  
   - Integrate with a sample codebase (e.g., a Java/Python GitHub repo).  

2. **Analysis**:  
   - Run a SonarQube scan and export the report.  
   - Identify top 3 critical issues (e.g., security vulnerabilities, code smells).  

3. **Action Plan**:  
   - Refactor code to fix one "Blocker" and two "Critical" issues.  
   - Document before/after code snippets and debt reduction metrics.  

4. **Verification**:  
   - Rescan the code to validate reduced technical debt.  
   - Compare SonarQube dashboards (initial vs. post-fix).  

**Deliverables**:  
   - PDF report with screenshots of SonarQube findings.  
   - Refactored code commits (GitHub link).  
   - 1-page summary of lessons learned.
