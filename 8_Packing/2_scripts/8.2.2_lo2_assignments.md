assignment:
  lesson: "Lesson 2 - Analyze SonarQube Reports to Reduce Technical Debt"
  description: "In this assignment, you will analyze SonarQube reports to identify and address technical debt in the codebase. The goal is to understand the key metrics provided by SonarQube and how they can be used to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the code."
  duration: "3 minutes"
  instructions:
    - "Watch the provided videos: [[video1]], [[video2]], [[video3]]."
    - "Use the provided codebase [[codebase]] to analyze the SonarQube report."
    - "Identify key areas where technical debt is present and suggest practical improvements."
    - "Record your findings and suggestions in a report format, focusing on the most critical issues."
    - "Ensure you highlight areas such as code duplication, complexity, and test coverage gaps."
    - "After completing the analysis, implement at least one improvement in the codebase."
  web_reference: "To further explore SonarQube and how to interpret its reports, read the official documentation: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/"
  
in_video_questions:
  - "What is technical debt, and how can SonarQube help manage it?"
  - "Which SonarQube metrics are most critical when analyzing technical debt?"
  - "How does SonarQube define code duplication, and why is it important to address it?"
  - "What actions can you take to reduce code complexity based on SonarQube reports?"
  - "How can you ensure that your codebase maintains high test coverage according to SonarQube?"

### **InVideo Questions**  
**Overview**: Interactive questions to engage viewers during the video.  

**Prompt**: *"Create 5 in-video questions"*  

**Output**:  
1. **What is the primary purpose of SonarQubeâ€™s "Technical Debt" metric?**  
   - (A) Measure code coverage  
   - (B) Quantify effort to fix maintainability issues  
   - (C) Track sprint velocity  
   - (Answer: B)  

2. **True or False**: SonarQube can detect security vulnerabilities in addition to code smells.  
   - (Answer: True)

   - (A) Reliability  
   - (B) Maintainability  
   - (C) Security  
   - (Answer: A)  

4. **What does a "Blocker" severity issue imply?**  
   - (A) Low-priority cosmetic issue  
   - (B) Critical problem requiring immediate attention  
   - (C) Documentation suggestion  
   - (Answer: B)  

5. **How does fixing "Code Smells" impact technical debt?**  
   - (A) Increases debt temporarily  
   - (B) Reduces long-term maintenance costs

## Hands On Learning

- Overview: Hands on learning assignment 

- Prompt: Create a capstone project based on the code base

### Output 

### **Hands-On Learning**  
**Overview**: Capstone project to apply SonarQube analysis in a real-world scenario.  

**Prompt**: *"Create a capstone project based on the codebase"*  

**Output**:  
**Project Title**: **"Technical Debt Reduction Sprint"**  
**Steps**:  
1. **Setup**:  
   - Install SonarQube locally or use a cloud instance.  
   - Integrate with a sample codebase (e.g., a Java/Python GitHub repo).  

2. **Analysis**:  
   - Run a SonarQube scan and export the report.  
   - Identify top 3 critical issues (e.g., security vulnerabilities, code smells).  

3. **Action Plan**:  
   - Refactor code to fix one "Blocker" and two "Critical" issues.  
   - Document before/after code snippets and debt reduction metrics.  

4. **Verification**:  
   - Rescan the code to validate reduced technical debt.  
   - Compare SonarQube dashboards (initial vs. post-fix).  

**Deliverables**:  
   - PDF report with screenshots of SonarQube findings.  
   - Refactored code commits (GitHub link).  
   - 1-page summary of lessons learned.
