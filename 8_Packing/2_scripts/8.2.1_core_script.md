#### LO1-V82: MANAGING TECHNICAL DEBT FOR AGILITY IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE ️    / SCENE ID 083
[CONTEXT] 
🔄 In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), managing technical debt is critical for ensuring that your system remains agile and adaptable to change, such as new features or contracts.  
[SHOW] 
📊 SonarQube will display your vulnerabilities, code smells, duplicated code, and overall technical debt, helping you track and manage these issues throughout the development process.  
[DO] 
❓ The Unknown is how quickly the technical debt will accumulate and when it will become a barrier to progress. ✅ The Known is that static code analysis tools like SonarQube can identify and quantify this debt, allowing you to make informed decisions about paying down the debt before it negatively impacts system agility.  
[CLOSING] 
⚡ By proactively addressing technical debt, you maintain the agility of your software, enabling you to add new features and scale without compromising the stability of the codebase.  

#### LO1-V83: TRACING FAILURES THROUGH GITHUB ACTIONS AND IMPROVING ARCHITECTURE 🚦    / SCENE ID 084
[CONTEXT] 
🔄 Every time you make a commit, it triggers a workflow.  
[SHOW] 
📊 GitHub Actions will display each commit ID and the associated pipeline status: ✅ (success), ❌ (failure), or 🟡 (in progress). This lets you monitor what's happening with each change in real-time.  
[DO] 
❓ The Unknown is where it might fail—could be the GitHub agent, the host environment, SonarQube, or your actual codebase. ✅ The Known is that you can now trace the full pipeline and identify which component caused the failure. By systematically investigating and fixing issues, you not only eliminate bugs but also strengthen your architecture and reduce technical debt over time.  
[CLOSING] 
🔄 This repetitive troubleshooting becomes your training ground—the more you fix, the more resilient and maintainable your codebase becomes.  

#### LO1-V84: UNDERSTANDING LINE COUNTS AND INTENTIONAL FAILURES 📏❌    / SCENE ID 085
[CONTEXT] 
📊 When working with SonarQube and code analysis tools, total lines of code and covered/uncovered lines become key indicators of your project's size and testing depth.  
[SHOW] 
📏 Whether you're working with a 100-line prototype or a million-line monolith, the scale changes how you approach test coverage.  
[DO] 
❓ The Unknown is why certain errors, like an intentional divide-by-zero, don't fail as expected—is it the test setup, the analysis timing, or the coverage scope? ✅ The Known is that basic errors should fail, and if they don't, that tells you something critical about your validation pipeline. Injecting intentional bugs helps you verify that your fail-safes actually fail when they should, and ensures that real bugs won't silently pass through.  
[CLOSING] 
🔍 By understanding line counts and testing intentional failures, you ensure your validation pipeline is robust and reliable.  

#### LO1-V85: HANDLING AUTO SHUTDOWNS AND CALLBACK FAILURES IN CODESPACES ⚠️🧵    / SCENE ID 086
[CONTEXT] 
⚠️ In dynamic environments like Codespaces, auto shutdowns can unexpectedly disrupt your system, especially if your SonarQube callback URLs or agent resources are tied to ephemeral infrastructure.  
[SHOW] 
🔄 When Codespaces reset, your callback URLs and GitHub Actions agents may lose access, breaking the feedback loop from SonarQube.  
[DO] 
❓ The Unknown is when a failure occurs—during a shutdown, a callback attempt, or due to resource exhaustion. ✅ The Known is that your system involves multiple moving parts (host, agent, SonarQube, callbacks). Track them through your logs, GitHub Actions panel, and resource dashboards. If this is proof of concept, you can debug and reset. If this is production, consider stabilizing infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) or persistent cloud services to avoid such fragility.  
[CLOSING] 
🛠️ Handling auto shutdowns and callback failures ensures your system remains stable and operational, even in dynamic environments.  

#### LO1-V86: TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PAID SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DEBT MANAGEMENT ️    / SCENE ID 087
[CONTEXT] 
💰 In your workflow, paying for persistent cloud resources (like always-on Codespaces or enterprise SonarQube) is a way to avoid sudden shutdowns and maintain continuity.  
[SHOW] 
⚖️ However, it shifts the pressure to monetary investment, accelerating the need to move beyond the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage.  
[DO] 
❓ The Unknown is how much money or time is needed to support a reliable, always-on infrastructure. ✅ The Known is that every unpaid service has limits—just like technical debt, if ignored, these systems will eventually expire or break. Learn to distinguish: PoC: Short-term testing, cheap, fragile. Prototype: Feature exploration, still flexible but more refined. Pilot: Limited launch with monitoring, investment-ready. Production: Stable, optimized, and must be funded and supported.  
[CLOSING] 
⚖️ Making strategic trade-offs between paid services and technical debt management ensures your system evolves sustainably and efficiently.
