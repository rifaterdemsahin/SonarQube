[DO] The Unknown is when a failure occurs—during a shutdown, a callback attempt, or due to resource exhaustion. The Known is that your system involves multiple moving parts (host, agent, SonarQube, callbacks). Track them through your logs, GitHub Actions panel, and resource dashboards. If this is proof of concept, you can debug and reset. If this is production, consider stabilizing infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) or persistent cloud services to avoid such fragility.  
[CLOSING] Handling auto shutdowns and callback failures ensures your system remains stable and operational, even in dynamic environments.  

#### LO1-V86: TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PAID SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DEBT MANAGEMENT 💸🔄    / SCENE ID 0
[CONTEXT] In your workflow, paying for persistent cloud resources (like always-on Codespaces or enterprise SonarQube) is a way to avoid sudden shutdowns and maintain continuity.  
[SHOW] However, it shifts the pressure to monetary investment, accelerating the need to move beyond the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage.  
[DO] The Unknown is how much money or time is needed to support a reliable, always-on infrastructure. The Known is that every unpaid service has limits—just like technical debt, if ignored, these systems will eventually expire or break. Learn to distinguish: PoC: Short-term testing, cheap, fragile. Prototype: Feature exploration, still flexible but more refined. Pilot: Limited launch with monitoring, investment-ready. Production: Stable, optimized, and must be funded and supported.  
[CLOSING] Making strategic trade-offs between paid services and technical debt management ensures your system evolves sustainably and efficiently.  

#### LO1-V87: WRAPPING UP – FROM TECHNICAL DEBT TO DAILY DEPLOYMENTS 🚀🧰    / SCENE ID 0
[CONTEXT] As we close this session, remember the real goal isn’t just to analyze code quality—it’s to build a healthy release pipeline where daily deployments are possible, technical debt is manageable, and everyone in the team benefits from a smooth developer experience.  
[SHOW] The Unknown is how fast you can move without breaking things—because growth means more features, more users, and more pressure.  
[DO] The Known is that doing the work now (yes, your assignments and hands-on practice!) will equip you with the tools to: Monitor code quality, Understand failures, Fix fast, Deliver continuously.  
[CLOSING] Let’s keep building—and stay connected for future courses where we dive into AI-assisted deployments, microservice architecture, zero-downtime rollouts, and more. 🎯 “Technical debt is like financial debt. Ignore it, and the interest compounds. Face it, and your future becomes freer.”
