```bash
kubectl port-forward -n sonarqube svc/sonarqube 9000:9000
```

## Knowledge Check (30s)
> Which command verifies if your SonarQube pods are running correctly?
> a) kubectl get pods
> b) kubectl get pods -n sonarqube

# Module 3: Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD

## INTRODUCTION

**[Speaker Notes]**

Hello, and welcome back to "Code Quality with SonarQube". This module number three is titled "Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD". 

## CONCEPT EXPLANATION

**[Speaker Notes]**

The key objective of this module is to show you how we can integrate SonarQube into the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process, usually abbreviated as CI/CD.

By integrating SonarQube with CI/CD, we ensure the code quality is kept in check automatically at every code commit and before each deployment to different environments.

## PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION

**[Speaker Notes]**

Let's start with an example using Jenkins, a popular CI/CD tool. 

In your Jenkins job, typically you'll add a build step to execute shell commands for starting a SonarQube analysis. In your Jenkins Pipeline's script, you'll introduce stages that call `mvn sonar:sonar` or similar commands depending on the build tool in use. The `-Dsonar.host.url` and `-Dsonar.login` parameters are used to specify the URL of the SonarQube server and the authentication.

Next, in the SonarQube server, go to the administration section, under 'CI/CD Integration'. Here, generate a token and use it in Jenkins to allow the CI/CD pipeline to interact with SonarQube.

Remember, it is important to fail the build when quality gate checks fail, which you achieve by adding a quality gate status check in Jenkins.

## SUMMARY

**[Speaker Notes]**

Just to recap, we covered the need for integrating SonarQube into CI/CD. We walked through an example of how this integration can be done using Jenkins. Finally, we learned how to fail the build when the code quality checks don't pass so that issues can be addressed immediately.

Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD is a powerful way to enforce quality checks throughout the development process, leading to cleaner and more reliable code.

---

(Note: There is no transition to next module since this is the final module.)
  
This concludes our third and final module, "Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD". Hopefully, you now have a clearer understanding on how to leverage SonarQube to its full capacities and increase your code's quality. Keep practicing, and soon you will see the tangible benefits of using this tool in your projects. Thank you for staying with us. Happy coding!

**COURSE TITLE:** Code Quality With SonarQube

**MODULE TITLE:** Analyzing Code with SonarQube

`---------------------------------------------------------------`

**[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction**

**(Speaker)**
_* (A slide showing the module title "Analyzing Code with SonarQube")*_

Hello everyone, I welcome you all to the second module of our course, "Code Quality with SonarQube". In this module, we will dive deeper into how to analyze code with SonarQube. Remember, code analysis will help you detect bugs and vulnerabilities, maintain code quality, and improve your software’s reliability over time.

`---------------------------------------------------------------`

**[0:30 - 1:30] Concept Explanation**  

**(Speaker)**
_* (Show a slide displaying the SonarQube interface with an annotated part indicating the code analysis section)*_

So, how does SonarQube analysis work?

SonarQube analysis is based on source files. It reads and interprets the code, using various language plugins. It performs issue detection, measures code coverage, computes duplication and complexity, and generates coding rule metrics. Also, it provides an overview of the quality of code. This is invaluable as it gives us pointers on where to focus our code improvement efforts.

`---------------------------------------------------------------`

**[1:30 - 3:30] Practical Example**

**(Speaker)**
_* (Show a code snippet on the screen)*_

Now, let's run through a practical example. 

Here, we have a piece of Java code. The code is not entirely bad, but we suspect it contains some vulnerabilities that could pose a risk to our application.

_* (Show how to run the code analysis in the SonarQube interface)*_

As you can observe, we will first set up SonarQube, pointing it at our codebase, then run the scanning process. 

Let's look at the results. 

_* (SonarQube dashboard displays the code issues)*_

See, it detected some code smells, security hotspots, and even a couple of bugs! And just like that, we can see where our attention is needed. 

And not only that, but SonarQube also points you directly to the problematic lines of code and offers tips on how to refactor them to enhance our code quality.

Now, isn't that insightful?

`---------------------------------------------------------------`

**[3:30 - 3:50] Summary**

**(Speaker)**
_* ( A slide displaying key points of the module)*_

In summary, an essential tool in maintaining high-quality code is conducting regular, thorough analyses. SonarQube not only detect issues but can also help you learn and adopt coding best practices, ultimately making you a better developer.

`---------------------------------------------------------------`

**[3:50 - 4:00] Transition to Next Module**

**(Speaker)**

With this essential knowledge about code analysis in SonarQube, we are ready to move to our third and final module. In the final module, we will explore more advanced use-cases, and you'll learn how to integrate SonarQube into your CI/CD pipelines for automated code quality checks. So, stay tuned!
