[SHOW] When Codespaces reset, your callback URLs and GitHub Actions agents may lose access, breaking the feedback loop from SonarQube.  
[DO] The Unknown is when a failure occurs—during a shutdown, a callback attempt, or due to resource exhaustion. The Known is that your system involves multiple moving parts (host, agent, SonarQube, callbacks). Track them through your logs, GitHub Actions panel, and resource dashboards. If this is proof of concept, you can debug and reset. If this is production, consider stabilizing infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) or persistent cloud services to avoid such fragility.  
[CLOSING] Handling auto shutdowns and callback failures ensures your system remains stable and operational, even in dynamic environments.  

#### LO1-V86: TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PAID SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DEBT MANAGEMENT 💸🔄  
[CONTEXT] In your workflow, paying for persistent cloud resources (like always-on Codespaces or enterprise SonarQube) is a way to avoid sudden shutdowns and maintain continuity.  
[SHOW] However, it shifts the pressure to monetary investment, accelerating the need to move beyond the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage.  
[DO] The Unknown is how much money or time is needed to support a reliable, always-on infrastructure. The Known is that every unpaid service has limits—just like technical debt, if ignored, these systems will eventually expire or break. Learn to distinguish: PoC: Short-term testing, cheap, fragile. Prototype: Feature exploration, still flexible but more refined. Pilot: Limited launch with monitoring, investment-ready. Production: Stable, optimized, and must be funded and supported.  
[CLOSING] Making strategic trade-offs between paid services and technical debt management ensures your system evolves sustainably and efficiently.  

#### LO1-V87: WRAPPING UP – FROM TECHNICAL DEBT TO DAILY DEPLOYMENTS 🚀🧰
