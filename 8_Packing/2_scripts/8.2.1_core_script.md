Lo1-v1-s1-whatsissonarqubet-tell-show
What is SonarQube and Why Do We Need It?
SonarQube is an essential tool in modern software development. Think of software as a building—it's not just about constructing it but maintaining its quality over time. In the Software Development Life Cycle [4.20.1_sonarqube_cycle.png](SDLC), technical debt accumulates as new requirements emerge. This is a normal part of development, but managing this debt effectively is critical.
The SDLC helps us package and address technical debt until new requirements arise. The key question is: when do we tackle this debt, and how do we allocate time for it? For a project to move forward, we need a structured process to measure and manage technical debt, much like using a scale to track progress.
In today’s fast-paced world, AI is accelerating the rate of change, making it even more important to have tools like SonarQube. It provides a clear environment to measure, analyze, and reduce technical debt, ensuring your software remains maintainable and scalable.

Lo1-v1-s1-sonarqube-benefits-tell

- **Debt Management**: By identifying and addressing technical debt, SonarQube allows you to focus on adding new features while keeping your codebase maintainable.
These benefits make SonarQube an essential tool for modern software development.
- **CI/CD Integration**: It seamlessly integrates into your CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous code quality checks with every commit.Elephant we need to sort out!

Lo1-v2-s1-Setup pick environment-tell-show 
Our initial objective is to set up the environment effectively. The most challenging setup will be for production, but in this course, we are focusing on building a portfolio and presenting your ideas confidently. To achieve this, we will concentrate on Proof of Concept environments, which are primarily infrastructure-as-code-based setups such as Codespaces.
While choosing the environment, it’s natural to have preferences. For instance, I am building this course on [4.2_windows_structure_install.png](Windows) but have chosen to work on Codespaces. The key takeaway is to learn how to restore and fix SonarQube components by applying first principles. This foundational knowledge mixed with AI first implementation will empower you to handle any environment with confidence.

LO1-v2-s2-shortcuts-tell-show
The ultimate shortcut is to use a [4.18.1_cloud_implementations.png](cloud-based rental system) for SonarQube. This eliminates the need for setup, allowing you to quickly start scanning projects. While this approach is convenient, it’s crucial to understand the deployment components, as SonarQube is often used in enterprise environments. Learning these fundamentals ensures a first-principles approach, enabling you to adapt to various project requirements. We’re focusing on this method not because it’s easy, but because mastering the setup process builds a deeper understanding. This knowledge is invaluable, especially when working with dynamic environments like Codespaces, which can be ephemeral by nature.

LO1-v2-s3-infradebt-tell-show  
SonarQube is a tool for managing technical debt, a critical yet often overlooked concept in IT. Technical debt refers to the compromises made in infrastructure or code that may lead to future challenges. In this course, we rely on GitHub Codespaces to host processes for running SonarQube. While the free tier contract(debt) offers a limited timeline, it introduces potential trade-offs, such as resource shutdowns. Students should focus on understanding these trade-offs and learning how to restore components when needed. [4.19.1_codespacescost2025April.png](For basic usage in this course,) the free tier suffices, but exceeding limits may incur additional costs. Manage resources wisely!

LO1-v2-SettingUpEnvironment-tell  
For most students, accessing the environment requires virtualization. Setting up the environment is our primary goal and a critical task. We should approach it in a way that allows us to rebuild it with ease. This is about becoming skilled, and I wasn’t always in that position. Initially, I looked for shortcuts, but I’ve come to realize that this is one of the harder yet more meaningful ways to build it.  
The system we are building will face challenges staying online, but these challenges will provide valuable learning opportunities. My proof-of-concept choice is Linux and a cloud-based solution called Codespaces, which has a strong community behind it.  
As a side note, this might feel like a bit of "yak shaving," but this Kubernetes and cloud-based vision will pay off for IT professionals in the long run. Trust me, I was once skeptical of this approach, but it has proven to be invaluable.

LO1:v3:linuxBased-Show-Do
Our pick is GitHub Codespaces. First, create your GitHub account, repository, and Codespaces environment on the GitHub platform. Our goal is to access the Minikube resource, which has already been deployed there. The free account provides temporary access to run the `minikube start` command. 
There are no excuses, such as not having access to a machine or being unable to open a GitHub repository. Codespaces offers a portfolio-ready environment for IT professionals, including tools like GitHub Actions. 
Please open the terminal, run the command, and watch Minikube go online. Once it's running, we can proceed to install the SonarQube platform on it.

# Module 3: Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD

## INTRODUCTION

**[Speaker Notes]**

Hello, and welcome back to "Code Quality with SonarQube". This module number three is titled "Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD". 

## CONCEPT EXPLANATION

**[Speaker Notes]**

The key objective of this module is to show you how we can integrate SonarQube into the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process, usually abbreviated as CI/CD.

By integrating SonarQube with CI/CD, we ensure the code quality is kept in check automatically at every code commit and before each deployment to different environments.

## PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION

**[Speaker Notes]**

Let's start with an example using Jenkins, a popular CI/CD tool. 

In your Jenkins job, typically you'll add a build step to execute shell commands for starting a SonarQube analysis. In your Jenkins Pipeline's script, you'll introduce stages that call `mvn sonar:sonar` or similar commands depending on the build tool in use. The `-Dsonar.host.url` and `-Dsonar.login` parameters are used to specify the URL of the SonarQube server and the authentication.

Next, in the SonarQube server, go to the administration section, under 'CI/CD Integration'. Here, generate a token and use it in Jenkins to allow the CI/CD pipeline to interact with SonarQube.

Remember, it is important to fail the build when quality gate checks fail, which you achieve by adding a quality gate status check in Jenkins.

## SUMMARY

**[Speaker Notes]**

Just to recap, we covered the need for integrating SonarQube into CI/CD. We walked through an example of how this integration can be done using Jenkins. Finally, we learned how to fail the build when the code quality checks don't pass so that issues can be addressed immediately.

Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD is a powerful way to enforce quality checks throughout the development process, leading to cleaner and more reliable code.

(Note: There is no transition to next module since this is the final module.)
  
This concludes our third and final module, "Integrating SonarQube with CI/CD". Hopefully, you now have a clearer understanding on how to leverage SonarQube to its full capacities and increase your code's quality. Keep practicing, and soon you will see the tangible benefits of using this tool in your projects. Thank you for staying with us. Happy coding!
