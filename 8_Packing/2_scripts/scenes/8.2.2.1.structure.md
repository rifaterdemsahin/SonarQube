Summary Talking Head

PART 1: STRUCTURED PLAN FOR 15 SCENES
Each scene will focus on a different topic or location. You can customize this to your subject.

Scene	Topic/Map Focus	Notes / Interaction Idea

2	Historical Background	Pinpoint key historical sites
3	Geography / Terrain	Show topography layers
4	Demographics	Overlay population heatmap
5	Urban Areas	Show major cities + infrastructure
6	Natural Resources	Display resource distribution
7	Climate Zones	Use color-coded climate overlays
8	Transportation Routes	Animate highways, railways, air routes
9	Cultural Sites	Pin drop museums, temples, landmarks
10	Environmental Challenges	Highlight deforestation/flood zones
11	Economic Activity	Trade routes, industry zones
12	Political Divisions	Draw borders, overlay gov structure
13	Education & Institutions	Show schools, universities, literacy zones
14	Health & Infrastructure	Hospitals, clean water access

# SCENE 1: Overview of the Region

## 1. INTRO TALKING HEAD
"Welcome to our journey! Today we're starting with an overview of the region we'll be exploring throughout this series. You'll see how geography, history, and people all intersect in fascinating ways. By the end, you'll know exactly where we’re headed—and why it matters."

## 2. SLIDES
- Regional location on world map
- Neighboring countries
- Key stats: area, population
- Why this region matters today

## 3. SCREEN CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS
- Start at world map level
- Zoom into the target region slowly
- Highlight country borders
- Toggle satellite view briefly
- Add a text overlay with the name of the region

## 4. SUMMARY TALKING HEAD
"So that’s the region we’ll dive into over the next episodes. One big takeaway? Location really shapes everything. What’s one thing that surprised you about where this region sits on the map?"
Would you like me to generate the prompt files for all 15 scenes now, or export them into a downloadable format like Markdown or Word?

You said:
In one file define the marp structure
ChatGPT said:
Great! Below is a single file defining the MARP (Markdown Presentation) structure for all 15 scenes, each with 4 sections: Intro Talking Head, Slides, Map Capture, and Summary. You can copy and paste this into a .md file and open it with MARP to render the slide deck.

ChatGPT said:
To organize your 15-scene video structure with 4 parts each (Intro Talking Head, Slides, Map Capture, Summary Talking Head), you should create one master Marp .md file, and optionally 15 individual prompt .md files for generating scripts using ChatGPT or other AI tools.

How to Use It:
Save it as generate-scenes.sh.

Make it executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x generate-scenes.sh
Run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
./generate-scenes.sh
This will generate 15 Markdown files inside a scenes/ folder, ready for editing or generation. Want a version that also includes some example content in the script sections?

You said:
Give a cose to generate the scenes from the metadata and write the metadata gile for each scene. Have 3 sections tell show do 
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here’s a structured system to manage and generate your scene .md files using a metadata-driven approach.

We’ll do three things:

1. Metadata Format (YAML per scene)
2. Markdown Template (with tell, show, do)
3. Code to Auto-Generate Markdown from Metadata
1. Metadata Files
Create a folder named metadata/ and inside it, create 15 files:

Example: metadata/scene01.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
scene: 1
title: Overview of the Region
tell: >
  Introduce the region and set the stage for why this area matters globally.
  Mention key stats and tease what’s coming in the series.

show: >
  - Map zoom from world to region
  - Country borders, major landmarks
  - Highlight geographical context

do: >
  Encourage viewers to comment what they already know about the region.
  Ask a simple question for engagement.
Repeat for scene02.yaml, scene03.yaml, ..., scene15.yaml.

2. Markdown Output Format
Each scene .md file will follow this structure using tell / show / do.

Example Output: scenes/scene01-overview.md
markdown
Copy
Edit
# Scene 01 – Overview of the Region

---

## 1. Intro Talking Head

### Tell
Introduce the region and set the stage for why this area matters globally.
Mention key stats and tease what’s coming in the series.

---

## 2. Slides

### Show
- Map zoom from world to region
- Country borders, major landmarks
- Highlight geographical context

---

## 3. Map Capture Instructions

### Do
Encourage viewers to comment what they already know about the region.
Ask a simple question for engagement.

Perfect. Let's now adapt the plan to strictly include the 4 scene sections you specified:

We will:

Define the updated YAML metadata format per scene

Update the Markdown template generator

Provide the complete Bash + Python system

1. Updated YAML Metadata Format (Per Scene)
Each file will live in the metadata/ folder as scene01.yaml, scene02.yaml, etc.
