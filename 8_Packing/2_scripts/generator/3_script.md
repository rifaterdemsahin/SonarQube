Welcome! Technical debt hinders speed and quality. SonarQube helps manage it. Integrate it for code analysis, debt reduction, and production-ready releases. Build a strong foundation, one clean commit at a time.


### 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Introduction

**Hook:**  Hello, I'm Rifat Erdem Sahin. With extensive IT experience, I've delivered many projects globally. At Accenture, I used SonarQube to ensure code quality and maintainability. Had the chance to work in big and small projects and saw a spectrum of diffent styles.

I soon realised the technical debt is the reason why the projects come to stop. With the rise of AI it becomes more and more important how to manage it as the code is written by AI faster and more very single day.


### 🗺️ Course Overview
Hey there! Let me walk you through what we're going to cover in this course. First, we'll dive into understanding what technical debt really is - you know, that thing that keeps haunting our codebases! Then, we'll explore how to work with existing technical debt in our projects. And most importantly, we'll learn practical ways to pay off that debt and stay aware of it before it becomes a monster. Trust me, by the end of this course, you'll be a technical debt management pro!

### 🔑 Key Takeaways
You know what's really exciting? By the end of this course, you'll be able to turn that pesky infrastructure debt into something amazing - a powerful development tool that actually works for you! We'll dive into modern tools that make building software a breeze, and I'll show you my favorite tricks for managing technical debt. The best part? You'll learn how to tackle that debt head-on, which means you can keep moving forward without getting stuck. It's like having a secret weapon in your development toolkit!

### 👋 Closing Remarks
You now know why it is so important to be aware of technical debt. All the skills you learn here would build on to each other. I would also help you showcase your skills and set our vision to have new standart for our development life cycle.
