              Welcome to our SonarQube course! In today's software world, technical debt is the silent killer of speed, quality, and innovation. Managing it isn't optional—it's essential. SonarQube helps you catch debt early, fix it fast, and keep your projects healthy for the long run.
              This course will show you how to integrate SonarQube into your development lifecycle to analyze code, pay down technical debt, and ensure your releases are always production-ready. We'll break down the first principles of debt management, so you're not just fixing bugs—you're building a system that prevents them.
              SonarQube isn't just about spotting vulnerabilities or messy code; it's about giving you a clear path to reduce technical debt systematically. By weaving it into your workflow, you'll boost maintainability, security, and developer happiness. Think of it as building a strong foundation—one clean commit at a time.
              Let's dive in and transform how you manage your codebase! Together, we'll learn to see technical debt before it sees us, make smart payments on it daily, and drive projects that are fast, flexible, and future-proof. 🚀
