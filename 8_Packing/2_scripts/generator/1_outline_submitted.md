PART 1 - OUTLINE: COURSE OVERVIEW 

Course Title:   SonarQube Essentials: Setup, Configure, and Integrate 

Lead Instructor: Rifat Erdem Sahin 

Course Description:   

 

According to SonarSource, technical debt in a codebase of 1 million lines can cost an organization over $300,000 annually—the equivalent of 5,500 developer hours. In today's fast-paced development landscape, maintaining high code quality and robust security is more critical than ever. SonarQube helps teams continuously inspect codebases, identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells across multiple programming languages.  

 

 

This comprehensive course equips software developers and DevOps professionals with practical skills to effectively utilize SonarQube for enhancing code quality and security. You’ll learn how to set up and configure SonarQube, integrate it into CI/CD workflows, and interpret key metrics like code coverage, maintainability, and reliability to assess code health. Through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies, you will practice identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities and code issues, applying best practices to maintain high standards.  

By the end, you will be confident in using SonarQube to ensure your codebases are clean, secure, and aligned with industry standards.  Ready to level up your code quality? Let’s dive in."

 Continuous Code Scanning with SonarQube in GitHub Workflows 

Peer Review 

LO2+LO3 

At CodeWave Inc., a code quality-first company, developers must catch issues early. You’ve been asked to set up automated SonarQube scanning in your repository to detect code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities with every commit or pull request. 

Scenario: 

You are working on a backend service in a shared repository. Your goal is to integrate SonarQube scanning into the CI pipeline, so each commit triggers analysis and reports on code quality directly in GitHub. 

Challenge: 

Set up a SonarQube project (local or hosted). 

Configure your repository with a SonarScanner config file (e.g., sonar-project.properties). 

Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs SonarScanner on push/PR. 

Make code changes intentionally introducing at least 2 code smells (e.g., long functions, duplicate code). 

Push changes and verify that the SonarQube scan detects the smells. 

Fix the issues and demonstrate improvement in the next scan. 

Open a pull request and request peer review. 

Deliverables: 

GitHub repository with a functioning sonar-project.properties 

GitHub Actions workflow running on commits/PRs
