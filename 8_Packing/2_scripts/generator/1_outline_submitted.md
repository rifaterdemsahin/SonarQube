# SonarQube Essentials: Setup, Configure, and Integrate

**Lead Instructor:** Rifat Erdem Sahin

## Course Description

According to SonarSource, technical debt in a codebase of 1 million lines can cost an organization over $300,000 annually—the equivalent of 5,500 developer hours. In today's fast-paced development landscape, maintaining high code quality and robust security is more critical than ever. SonarQube helps teams continuously inspect codebases, identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells across multiple programming languages.

This comprehensive course equips software developers and DevOps professionals with practical skills to effectively utilize SonarQube for enhancing code quality and security. You'll learn how to set up and configure SonarQube, integrate it into CI/CD workflows, and interpret key metrics like code coverage, maintainability, and reliability to assess code health. Through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies, you will practice identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities and code issues, applying best practices to maintain high standards.

By the end, you will be confident in using SonarQube to ensure your codebases are clean, secure, and aligned with industry standards. Ready to level up your code quality? Let's dive in.
