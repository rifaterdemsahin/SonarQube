Based on your business model—creating a new course every 8 weeks, earning £1,000 upfront per course, and receiving 50% of the royalties—the estimated annual income would be approximately £12,000.

### Income Breakdown

* **Upfront Payments**: With 6 courses produced annually (one every 8 weeks), at £1,000 each, you would earn £6,000.

* **Royalties**: Assuming each course generates £2,000 in total revenue and you receive a 50% share, that's £1,000 per course. Over 6 courses, this amounts to £6,000.

**Total Estimated Annual Income**: £6,000 (upfront) + £6,000 (royalties) = £12,000

### Considerations

* **Platform Variability**: Royalty rates and revenue shares can vary significantly across platforms. For instance, Udemy offers 97% revenue share for instructor-promoted sales but only 37% for platform-driven sales .([enterprise-ai.io][1])

* **Marketing Efforts**: Your ability to promote your courses can significantly impact royalty earnings. Instructors who actively market their courses tend to earn more.([Kajabi | Where Creators Build Businesses][2])

* **Course Quality and Demand**: High-quality courses in high-demand niches (e.g., technology, business, personal development) are more likely to generate substantial royalties .([Sell Courses Online][3])

### Enhancing Your Income

To potentially increase your earnings:

* **Invest in Course Creation Resources**: Consider tools and guides that can help you create and market your courses effectively.

* **Optimize Your Marketing Strategy**: Leverage social media, email marketing, and other channels to promote your courses.

* **Explore Multiple Platforms**: Diversifying the platforms where you offer your courses can expose you to broader audiences.

By focusing on high-quality content creation and effective marketing, you can work towards increasing both your upfront payments and royalty earnings over time.
