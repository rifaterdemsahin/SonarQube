LO3: Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines for automated scans:

  prompt:
    - task: 
        description: Write a hands-on assignment for Lesson 3 on integrating SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines for automated scans.
        content: |
          **Objective**: 
          In this assignment, you'll learn how to integrate SonarQube into a CI/CD pipeline to perform automated scans on your codebase. The goal is to ensure code quality and security are continuously monitored in your development lifecycle.

          **Steps:**
          1. **Set up SonarQube**: Install SonarQube locally or use a cloud-based version. Create a SonarQube project for your code repository.
          2. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline**: Choose a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. You'll be configuring the pipeline to run SonarQube scans on every commit.
          3. **Install SonarQube Scanner**: Depending on the CI/CD tool you're using, install the appropriate SonarQube Scanner (e.g., `sonar-scanner-cli` for Jenkins).
          4. **Create a SonarQube Analysis Configuration**: Define the analysis properties (e.g., project key, source directory) in a `sonar-project.properties` file or in the CI/CD pipeline configuration.
          5. **Run the Scan**: Once the configuration is complete, trigger a commit and observe how the SonarQube scan runs automatically on the pipeline.
          6. **Review Scan Results**: After the scan, review the results in the SonarQube dashboard for code quality, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
          
          **Expected Outcome**:
          You should have an automated SonarQube scan integrated into your CI/CD pipeline that runs with each new commit, and you should be able to view the results on SonarQube.
         Estimated Time: 20 minutes
         Requirement: The maximum duration of an HOL activity can be 20 minutes. It is supposed to be a short hands-on activity that the learners can perform to practice the skills they have learned in the previous video.

        **Script (max 3 minutes)**:
        In this lesson, we'll guide you through integrating SonarQube into a CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality scans. SonarQube is a powerful tool that can analyze your codebase and provide insights on quality and security. In this practical assignment, we'll be setting up SonarQube to scan your code every time new changes are pushed to your repository.

        First, you'll need to install SonarQube and configure a project in it. Once that's set up, you'll move on to your CI/CD pipeline. For this tutorial, we’ll use GitHub Actions as an example, but this process can easily be adapted to other tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.

        After setting up your CI/CD tool, you’ll install the SonarQube Scanner. This tool allows SonarQube to analyze your project’s code every time a commit is made. You’ll create a configuration file, typically named `sonar-project.properties`, where you define settings like the project key and source directory. 

        Once everything is in place, you’ll commit your changes, and the CI/CD pipeline will trigger the SonarQube scan automatically. In the end, you can go to your SonarQube dashboard to review the scan results and see any issues that might need attention.

        Remember, the goal here is to make sure that the code quality is continuously monitored and improved in an automated way. Happy coding, and be sure to check out the full documentation linked below for more details.

## Hands-On Learning  
**Overview:** Capstone project to apply theoretical knowledge practically.  

### Capstone Project: **SonarQube CI/CD Integration**  
**Objective:**  
Build a CI/CD pipeline with SonarQube integration to enforce automated code quality checks.  

#### Steps:  
1. **Set Up a Sample Application**  
   - Use a simple Java/Python/Node.js app in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).  

2. **Configure SonarQube**  
   - Deploy SonarQube locally (Docker) or via SonarCloud.  
   - Create a project and generate an authentication token.  

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**  
   - **Example Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.  
   - Add pipeline steps to:  
     - Trigger SonarQube scans on commits/pull requests.  
     - Enforce Quality Gate conditions (e.g., zero bugs, 80% code coverage).  

4. **Test the Pipeline**  
   - Introduce intentional code smells (e.g., unused variables, security vulnerabilities).  
   - Verify pipeline failure when Quality Gates are breached.  

5. **Documentation & Deliverables**  
   - Screenshots of SonarQube dashboards showing issues.  
   - Pipeline configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/sonar.yml`).  
   - Reflection on challenges and solutions.  

#### Expected Outcomes:  
- Automated code quality enforcement in CI/CD.  
- Demonstrated ability to block substandard code merges.
