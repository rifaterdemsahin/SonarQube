# Understanding the Process of Creating a Delivery Pilot: From Outline to Delivery of a Course

Creating a television pilot involves several critical stages, each building upon the last to craft a compelling and cohesive narrative. Below is an overview of these stages, incorporating Bloom's Taxonomy to highlight the cognitive processes involved.

## 1. Delivery Pilot

The **Delivery Pilot** is the finalized episode that introduces the series to the audience. It sets the tone, establishes characters, and presents the central narrative arc. This stage involves:

- **Creating**: Developing original content that engages and resonates with viewers.
- **Evaluating**: Assessing the pilot's effectiveness in conveying the intended message and eliciting the desired response from the audience.

## 2. Outline

An **Outline** serves as the blueprint for the pilot script. It provides a scene-by-scene breakdown of the narrative, ensuring logical flow and coherence. Key aspects include:

- **Remembering**: Recalling essential plot points and character developments.
- **Understanding**: Grasping the relationships between different story elements.
- **Applying**: Organizing information effectively to structure the narrative.
- **Analyzing**: Breaking down complex story arcs into manageable segments.

A detailed outline is crucial for identifying potential issues before the scriptwriting phase, saving time and resources. citeturn0search6

## 3. Scripting

**Scripting** is the process of transforming the outline into a full-fledged screenplay. This stage focuses on:

- **Applying**: Utilizing screenwriting techniques to translate the outline into visual and auditory elements.
- **Analyzing**: Ensuring dialogue and actions align with character development and plot progression.
- **Evaluating**: Reviewing the script for pacing, coherence, and emotional impact.

A well-crafted script serves as the foundation for the pilot, guiding directors, actors, and crew in bringing the story to life. citeturn0search8

## 4. Screen Delivery Pilot Tell

This stage involves presenting the pilot to stakeholders, such as producers, networks, or test audiences. It includes:

- **Remembering**: Highlighting key themes and messages from the pilot.
- **Understanding**: Demonstrating how the pilot fits within the broader context of the series.
- **Applying**: Showcasing the pilot's potential for audience engagement and marketability.
- **Analyzing**: Gathering feedback to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

Effective delivery is essential for securing support and moving forward with the series.

## 5. Tell, Show, Do, Apply Model

Incorporating the **Tell, Show, Do, Apply** model enhances audience engagement and learning. This approach is particularly useful in educational or instructional content within the pilot.

- **Tell**: Introduce concepts or information to the audience.
- **Show**: Demonstrate these concepts through examples or narratives.
- **Do**: Encourage active participation or reflection from the audience.
- **Apply**: Guide the audience in applying the concepts to real-life scenarios.

This model promotes deeper understanding and retention of information. citeturn0search5

## 6. Remember, Understand, Evaluate, Apply

These stages align with Bloom's Taxonomy, representing a hierarchy of cognitive skills:

- **Remember**: Recall basic facts and concepts.
- **Understand**: Explain ideas or concepts.
- **Evaluate**: Judge the value of materials or methods.
- **Apply**: Use information in new situations.

In the context of a TV pilot, these stages ensure that the content is not only informative but also engaging and thought-provoking. citeturn0search3

## 7. Show, Do, Apply

This model emphasizes experiential learning, encouraging the audience to engage actively with the content:

- **Show**: Present information or scenarios.
- **Do**: Allow the audience to practice or experience the content.
- **Apply**: Enable the audience to use the knowledge in practical contexts.

Incorporating this approach can enhance viewer engagement and comprehension. citeturn0search5

## Conclusion

Developing a TV pilot is a multifaceted process that combines creative storytelling with structured planning and audience engagement strategies. By integrating models like Bloom's Taxonomy and the Tell, Show, Do, Apply approach, creators can craft pilots that are not only compelling but also intellectually stimulating, paving the way for successful series development.
