# Non-Graded Interactive Project: Codebase Scanning with SonarQube

### **Overview**:
This project allows the course taker to dive into the process of scanning a codebase using **SonarQube**. SonarQube is a tool that helps identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells by analyzing the quality of your codebase. In this non-graded interactive project, you'll scan a codebase for issues and explore how SonarQube provides feedback to improve the overall quality of your code.

### **Objectives**:
- Understand the purpose of SonarQube in maintaining code quality.
- Learn how to scan a codebase using SonarQube.
- Interpret the results of the SonarQube analysis to identify potential improvements in your code.
- Familiarize yourself with how to integrate SonarQube into a development workflow.

### **Instructions**:

1. **Set Up SonarQube**:
   - If you haven't done so already, you will need to set up SonarQube. You can either install it locally or use an online instance.
   - For local installation, follow the official guide [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup-and-installation/).
   - Once installed, start the SonarQube service, and access the web interface through the provided URL (default: `http://localhost:9000`).

2. **Choose or Create a Codebase**:
   - You can use any codebase for this exercise. If you donâ€™t have a project in mind, feel free to create a small application in any language (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python).
   - Ensure that the codebase has a variety of code quality issues to explore (e.g., duplicated code, complex methods, security vulnerabilities).

3. **Scan the Codebase with SonarQube**:
   - Install and configure the **SonarQube scanner** for your language or build tool. You can find instructions for different languages [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/).
   - Run the SonarQube scan on your codebase. This will generate a report that provides insights into the code quality, listing issues, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.

4. **Explore the SonarQube Dashboard**:
   - After the scan completes, open the SonarQube dashboard and view the analysis report.
   - Explore the following sections:
     - **Issues**: List of identified issues (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells).
     - **Measures**: Metrics such as code coverage, complexity, and duplications.
     - **Quality Gate**: Overview of whether your project meets the defined quality standards.
   
5. **Analyze and Interpret Results**:
   - Review the issues and try to understand their impact on the code quality.
   - Pay particular attention to high-severity issues such as security vulnerabilities or critical bugs.
   - Use the **SonarQube documentation** to help you understand the issue types and how to fix them.

6. **Reflection**:
   - Write down your thoughts on the process:
     - What issues did SonarQube identify in your codebase?
     - How would you prioritize fixing these issues?
     - What did you learn about maintaining code quality?

7. **Next Steps**:
   - SonarQube can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous code quality checks. If time allows, explore how you can automate code analysis as part of your build process using SonarQube's integration options for Jenkins, GitLab CI, or other tools.

### **Expected Outcomes**:
By the end of this interactive project, you should:
- Understand how SonarQube analyzes and reports on code quality.
- Be able to interpret SonarQube results and identify critical issues in your codebase.
- Learn how to improve code quality by fixing identified issues and making adjustments to your development workflow.

### **Additional Resources**:
- [SonarQube Documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/)
- [SonarQube GitHub repository](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube)
- [SonarQube Community](https://community.sonarsource.com/)

This project will help you gain a better understanding of the importance of automated code analysis and its role in ensuring code quality throughout the development lifecycle. Enjoy exploring SonarQube!
