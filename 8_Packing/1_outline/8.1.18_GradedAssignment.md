# **Graded Assignment: SonarQube Codebase Analysis**  

**Course:** Introduction to SonarQube for Static Code Analysis  
**Assignment Type:** Graded (Weight: 20%)  
**Total Points:** 100  
**Due Date:** [Insert Due Date]

## **Objective**  
This assignment evaluates your understanding of SonarQubeâ€™s key features, including code quality analysis, security vulnerability detection, and technical debt assessment. You will analyze a provided codebase, identify issues using SonarQube, and propose fixes.  

---

## **Tasks**  

### **Task 1: SonarQube Setup (20 Points)**  
1. Set up a local SonarQube instance using Docker or download the community edition.  
2. Configure a project in SonarQube for the provided codebase (link will be given).  
3. Run a SonarScanner analysis and submit a screenshot of the project dashboard.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Screenshot of the SonarQube project dashboard.  
- Brief explanation of the setup process (max 200 words).  

---

### **Task 2: Code Quality Analysis (30 Points)**  
Analyze the given codebase in SonarQube and answer the following:  
1. List the top 3 critical code smells detected. Explain why they are problematic.  
2. Identify 2 bugs reported by SonarQube. Describe their potential impact.  
3. What is the estimated technical debt for the project? Suggest one way to reduce it.  

**Deliverables:**  
- A report (max 500 words) summarizing findings.  
- Screenshots of SonarQube issues (highlighting critical ones).  

---

### **Task 3: Security Vulnerability Assessment (30 Points)**  
1. Identify 2 security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, hardcoded passwords).  
2. For each vulnerability:  
   - Explain the risk.  
   - Provide a code fix (pseudocode or actual code snippet).  
3. Compare the security rating before and after hypothetical fixes.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Vulnerability analysis (max 400 words).  
- Proposed fixes (code snippets or steps).  

---

### **Task 4: Refactoring & Improvement (20 Points)**  
1. Pick one major maintainability issue (e.g., high cyclomatic complexity).  
2. Refactor the code (submit before/after snippets).  
3. Explain how the refactor improves the code.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Refactored code snippet.  
- Explanation of improvements (max 300 words).  

---

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Submit a **PDF** containing all deliverables.  
- Include screenshots where necessary.  
- Follow proper formatting (headings, code blocks, etc.).
