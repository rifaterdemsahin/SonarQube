### Proof of Learning: SonarQube Course

- **Overview**: In this SonarQube course, learners demonstrate proficiency through a series of practical tasks, assessments, and collaborative evaluations. These tasks will involve analyzing code quality, identifying issues, and applying best practices using SonarQube tools and features. Each lesson reinforces the learning objectives through in-video questions to encourage active engagement and deeper understanding of key concepts.

---

#### Lesson 1: **Introduction to SonarQube and Code Quality**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What is the primary purpose of SonarQube in a software development pipeline, and how does it contribute to maintaining code quality?

#### Lesson 2: **Setting Up SonarQube and Integrating with Your Codebase**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: After setting up SonarQube, what is the first step to analyze your project’s codebase, and which configuration file do you need to modify?

#### Lesson 3: **Running a SonarQube Scan on Your Project**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: When running a SonarQube scan on your project, what are the key indicators that SonarQube provides to evaluate the quality of your code?

#### Lesson 4: **Understanding the SonarQube Dashboard and Metrics**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How can you interpret the "Code Smell" and "Bug" metrics on the SonarQube dashboard, and why are they important for maintaining code quality?

#### Lesson 5: **Fixing Issues Detected by SonarQube**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: After identifying a "Code Smell" or "Bug," what steps should you take to address these issues, and how can SonarQube help track the fixes over time?

#### Lesson 6: **Using Quality Gates in SonarQube**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How does the Quality Gate feature in SonarQube help enforce quality standards, and what happens when a project fails to meet these standards?

#### Lesson 7: **Advanced SonarQube Features: Custom Rules and Profiles**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What is the purpose of custom rules and quality profiles in SonarQube, and how can they be used to tailor code quality checks to specific project needs?

#### Lesson 8: **SonarQube Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How does integrating SonarQube into a CI/CD pipeline benefit the development workflow, and what actions can be automated during the build process?

#### Lesson 9: **SonarQube Reporting and Collaboration**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How can you share SonarQube analysis results with your team, and why is collaboration important when addressing code quality issues across different stages of the development lifecycle?

#### Lesson 10: **SonarQube Best Practices and Continuous Improvement**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What are some best practices for maintaining a high level of code quality over time using SonarQube, and how can you ensure continuous improvement in your development process?
