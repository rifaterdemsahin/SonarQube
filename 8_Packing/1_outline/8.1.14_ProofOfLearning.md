#### Lesson 1: **Introduction to SonarQube and Code Quality**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What is the primary purpose of SonarQube in a software development pipeline, and how does it contribute to maintaining code quality?

#### Lesson 2: **Setting Up SonarQube and Integrating with Your Codebase**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: After setting up SonarQube, what is the first step to analyze your projectâ€™s codebase, and which configuration file do you need to modify?

#### Lesson 3: **Running a SonarQube Scan on Your Project**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: When running a SonarQube scan on your project, what are the key indicators that SonarQube provides to evaluate the quality of your code?

#### Lesson 4: **Understanding the SonarQube Dashboard and Metrics**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How can you interpret the "Code Smell" and "Bug" metrics on the SonarQube dashboard, and why are they important for maintaining code quality?

#### Lesson 5: **Fixing Issues Detected by SonarQube**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: After identifying a "Code Smell" or "Bug," what steps should you take to address these issues, and how can SonarQube help track the fixes over time?

#### Lesson 6: **Using Quality Gates in SonarQube**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How does the Quality Gate feature in SonarQube help enforce quality standards, and what happens when a project fails to meet these standards?

#### Lesson 7: **Advanced SonarQube Features: Custom Rules and Profiles**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What is the purpose of custom rules and quality profiles in SonarQube, and how can they be used to tailor code quality checks to specific project needs?

#### Lesson 8: **SonarQube Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How does integrating SonarQube into a CI/CD pipeline benefit the development workflow, and what actions can be automated during the build process?

#### Lesson 9: **SonarQube Reporting and Collaboration**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: How can you share SonarQube analysis results with your team, and why is collaboration important when addressing code quality issues across different stages of the development lifecycle?

#### Lesson 10: **SonarQube Best Practices and Continuous Improvement**

- **In-Video Learning Question**: What are some best practices for maintaining a high level of code quality over time using SonarQube, and how can you ensure continuous improvement in your development process?
