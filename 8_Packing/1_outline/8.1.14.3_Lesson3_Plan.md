Overview:
  Title of the Lesson: "SonarQube Essentials: Code Quality & CI/CD Integration"
  Lesson Objective: "Learn to configure SonarQube, integrate it with CI/CD pipelines, and interpret code quality metrics for continuous inspection."
  Description: "This lesson teaches developers to implement SonarQube for static code analysis, covering project setup, scanning, and technical debt analysis. Participants will gain hands-on experience integrating SonarQube into development workflows to improve code security and maintainability."

Duration and Content:
  Lesson Duration: 15 minutes
  Content Structure:
    - Video 1 (5 min): "Setting up the SonarQube project"
    - Video 2 (5 min): "Initial Scan"
    - Video 3 (5 min): "Understanding the technical debt"

Prompt Response: |
  This 15-minute lesson focuses on SonarQube implementation for continuous code inspection. It covers three key areas: (1) Configuration of SonarQube projects and quality profiles, (2) Integration with CI/CD pipelines using scanners and webhooks for automated analysis, and (3) Interpretation of critical metrics like bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, coverage, and technical debt. The practical approach demonstrates how to embed SonarQube in development workflows to enforce quality gates, identify security hotspots, and track technical debt trends for better project health management in agile environments.

**Lesson Plan: Mastering SonarQube and Scan Projects**

**Objective:**  
Learn how to set up and configure SonarQube for continuous code inspection, integrating it with CI/CD pipelines, and analyzing code quality metrics to manage vulnerabilities.

**Description:**  
This 15-minute lesson introduces SonarQube, covering its setup, integration with CI/CD workflows, and code quality analysis. Through three 5-minute videos, learners will explore practical exercises, beginning with setting up a SonarQube project, performing an initial scan, and understanding technical debt to ensure high-quality and secure code in development environments.

**Duration:** 15 minutes (3 videos)
  Consists of 3 x 5-minute videos:  
  - **Video 1**: Scan Repo
  - **Video 2**: Add new code with AI
  - **Video 3**: Concepts Coverage and improvements
  - **Video 4**: Reminder Rebuild if codespaces is gone
