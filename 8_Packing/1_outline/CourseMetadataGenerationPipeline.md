# Course Metadata Generation Pipeline

I can help you create a YAML configuration and Python code for a more efficient course metadata generation pipeline. Your current approach of chaining outputs through multiple prompts is a good start, but we can improve it with a more structured flow that allows for better consistency, variation control, and preservation of instructional intent.

Let me create an artifact with both the YAML config and Python implementation:

## Recommended Approach for Course Metadata Generation

Based on your current multi-screen, back-to-back prompt flow, I've created a more structured pipeline approach that addresses your concerns about consistency, variation, and preserving instructional intent. Here's how this implementation improves upon your current process:

### Key Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Structured Dependencies**: Each generation step can explicitly depend on previous outputs, creating a clear flow of information.

2. **Consistency Control**: 
   - Shared system prompts maintain consistent tone
   - Earlier outputs are directly referenced in later prompts
   - Final compilation ensures all pieces work together

3. **Variation Management**:
   - Temperature settings can be adjusted per field
   - Python processing steps allow for deterministic calculations (like difficulty level)
   - Mix of GPT and rule-based generation for appropriate balance

4. **Instructional Intent Preservation**:
   - Detailed prompts capture specific requirements for each field
   - Specialized processors for different types of metadata
   - Step-specific system prompts when needed

### How It Works:

1. **Configuration-Driven**: All generation parameters, dependencies, and flow are defined in a YAML config file, making it easy to adjust without changing code.

2. **Multi-Processor Pipeline**: 
   - GPT processors for creative content (titles, descriptions)
   - Template processors for simple substitutions
   - Python processors for rule-based content (difficulty calculations, time estimates)

3. **Traceability**: Each step's output can be saved, letting you examine the chain of generation and identify where improvements are needed.

4. **Composable Final Output**: You define which fields from which steps make up your final metadata.
