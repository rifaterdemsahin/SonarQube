### Course Level: Intermediate

Based on the course structure and content, this SonarQube course is best suited for **intermediate-level** learners. It assumes participants have a foundational understanding of software development and DevOps practices, including familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and basic coding principles.

The course delves into practical applications of SonarQube, such as setup, configuration, and integration into development workflows. Participants will explore code quality metrics, identify and address security vulnerabilities, and apply best practices through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies.

This level of depth aligns with courses like the "SonarQube Essential Training" offered by DevOpsSchool, which is also categorized as intermediate and covers similar topics, including working with issues, rules, quality profiles, and quality gates

Therefore, this course is ideal for developers and DevOps professionals looking to enhance their code quality and security practices using SonarQube.
