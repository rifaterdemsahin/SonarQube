# Learning Objectives

```yaml
Course_Learning_Objectives_Design:
  Course_Focus: "Emphasize acquiring practical skills to implement SonarQube for continuous code quality monitoring and understanding its real-world impact through case studies."

  Main_Task: |
    In 350 words, define three key learning objectives for a SonarQube course.
    Focus on mastering setup, implementation, and configuration for continuous code quality monitoring.
    Additionally, provide three real-world case studies (100 words each) that illustrate how companies leveraged SonarQube to:
      - Enhance code quality
      - Improve application security
      - Optimize CI/CD processes
    Use measurable outcomes to emphasize practical application.

  Learning_Objectives_Guidelines:
    Total_Objectives: "1 to 4 Learning Objectives (LO1â€“LO4)"
    Max_Length_Per_Objective: "16 words"
    Bloom_Taxonomy_Level: "Apply-level or higher (LOs must be higher-order)"
    Objective_Stem: "By the end of this course, you will be able to..."
    Verb_Recommendations:
      Avoid: ["learn", "explore"]
      Use: ["implement", "analyze", "configure", "evaluate","create"]
    Example_Objectives:
      - "Recognize techniques for balancing form and function in data visualizations."
      - "Evaluate data visualizations to ensure they effectively communicate a story."

  Learning_Objectives:
    lo1: ""
    lo2: ""
    lo3: ""
    lo4: ""

  Notes:
    - "Refer to the whole codebase when discussing SonarQube implementation."
    - "Ensure all formatting follows clear Markdown structure."

```

## Markdown Output >
- **Lo1**: Install and configure SonarQube 
- **Lo2**: Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines for automated quality and security checks.
- **Lo3**: Analyze and interpret SonarQube reports to address technical debt effectively.
- **Lo4**: Apply SonarQube insights to improve code quality across the entire codebase.
