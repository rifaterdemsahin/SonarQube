# Learning Objectives

- **Prompt** : Emphasizes acquiring skills to implement SonarQube for continuous code quality monitoring and understanding its impact through real-world applications.
- **Prompt** : "In 350 words, define three key learning objectives for a SonarQube course, focusing on mastering setup, implementation and configuration for continuous code quality monitoring. Additionally, describe three real-world case studies (100 words each) demonstrating how companies leveraged SonarQube to enhance code quality, improve application security, and optimize CI/CD processes, emphasizing measurable outcomes to illustrate practical application."
- **Prompt** : Add 4 higher order learning objectives
- **Prompt** : Each learning objective less than 16 words
- **Prompt** : Lo1,Lo2,Lo3.Lo4 starter index
- **Prompt** : "Refer to whole codebase"
- **Prompt** : "Fix Format in Markdown"
- **Prompt** : "Course should have 1-4 learning objectives. There is one lesson for each of the course-level objectives
                A minimum of 2 LOs should be Apply-level or higher in Bloom's Taxonomy.  
                Course Learning objectives clearly state the specific, measurable, and actionable skills that learners will be able to do by the end of the course. 
                They should be phrased to finish the sentence 'By the end of this course you will. be able to...". 
                They should be results focused as in the following examples: 
                -Example Bloom's Level 2: Recognize techniques for balancing form and function in data visualizations. 
                -Example, Blooms Level 3: Evaluate data visualizations to ensure that they effectively and accurately communicate a story . 
                They should NOT focus on what the learner will do during the course (Learn, Explore)."

## Write Output >
- **Lo1**: Install and configure SonarQube for local and cloud environments.
- **Lo2**: Analyze and interpret SonarQube reports to address technical debt effectively.
- **Lo3**: Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines for automated quality and security checks.
- **Lo4**: Apply SonarQube insights to improve code quality across the entire codebase.
