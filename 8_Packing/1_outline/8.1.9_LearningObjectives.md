# Learning Objectives

## 📚 Course Learning Objectives Design Prompt

### 🎯 Course Focus:
Emphasize acquiring practical skills to **implement [[SonarQube]]** for **[[continuous code quality monitoring]]** and **understanding its real-world impact** through case studies.

---

### ✍️ Main Task:

**In 350 words**, define **three key learning objectives** for a [[SonarQube]] course.  
Focus on **[[mastering setup, implementation, and configuration** for continuous code quality monitoring]].

Additionally, provide **three real-world case studies** (100 words each) that illustrate how companies leveraged SonarQube to:

- [[Enhance code quality  ]]
- [[Improve application security  ]]
- [[Optimize CI/CD processes]]  

Use **measurable outcomes** to emphasize **practical application**.

---

### ✅ Learning Objectives (LOs) Guidelines:

- The course should have **1 to 4 Learning Objectives (LO1–LO4)**.  
- Each LO must be **less than 16 words**.  
- Include **4 higher-order learning objectives** based on Bloom's Taxonomy (Apply-level or higher).  
- Each lesson will be based on one course-level learning objective.  
- Use the following stem:  
  _"By the end of this course, you will be able to..."_

#### ✔️ Examples:
- **Bloom's Level 2**: Recognize techniques for balancing form and function in data visualizations.  
- **Bloom's Level 3**: Evaluate data visualizations to ensure they effectively communicate a story.

> ⚠️ Avoid verbs like *learn* or *explore*. Instead, use specific, measurable, and actionable verbs such as *implement*, *analyze*, *configure*, or *evaluate*.

---

### 💡 Notes:
- Refer to the **whole codebase** when discussing SonarQube implementation.  
- Ensure all formatting follows clear Markdown structure.


## Write Output >
- **Lo1**: Install and configure SonarQube for local and cloud environments.
- **Lo2**: Analyze and interpret SonarQube reports to address technical debt effectively.
- **Lo3**: Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines for automated quality and security checks.
- **Lo4**: Apply SonarQube insights to improve code quality across the entire codebase.
