The error in your GitHub Actions job is due to the SonarScanner failing to query the server version because the URL scheme (http or https) is missing.

Here's the relevant part in the log:
```
2025-04-04T21:19:54.179 ERROR Failed to query server version: Expected URL scheme 'http' or 'https' but no scheme was found for /api/v...
```

This suggests that the `SONAR_HOST_URL` secret might be incorrectly set or missing the URL scheme. To resolve this issue, please ensure that the `SONAR_HOST_URL` secret in your repository settings includes the proper URL scheme (e.g., `https://sonar.yourdomain.com`).

Here's the updated relevant part of your workflow if you need to double-check:

```yaml
env:
  SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
  SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```

To fix this, verify the `SONAR_HOST_URL` value in your repository's secrets:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Check the value of `SONAR_HOST_URL` and ensure it is correctly set with `http` or `https` scheme.

This should resolve the issue with the SonarScanner failing to query the server version.
