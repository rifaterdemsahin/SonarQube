# 🐳 SonarQube Setup in Docker on Minikube in GitHub Codespaces

## 📋 Setup Steps Checklist

Before you start executing commands, here's your complete setup process:

[+] 🚀 Start GitHub Codespaces environment
[+] 📦 Install required dependencies (Docker, kubectl, Minikube)
[-] 🔄 Start Minikube in Docker driver mode
[-] 🧩 Create Kubernetes namespace for SonarQube
[-] 💾 Create persistent volume claim for SonarQube data
[-] 🔐 Create secrets for database credentials
[-] 📊 Deploy PostgreSQL database for SonarQube
[-] 🔍 Deploy SonarQube server
[-] 🌐 Expose SonarQube service
[-] 🔄 Set up port forwarding to access SonarQube UI
[-] 🔑 Configure initial admin credentials
[-] ✅ Verify SonarQube deployment and accessibility

## ⚙️ Prerequisites and Notes

- GitHub Codespaces provides sufficient resources for a lightweight SonarQube instance
- We'll use Minikube to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database for SonarQube
- This setup is for development/testing purposes
- SonarQube requires adequate memory allocation (~2GB minimum)

Would you like me to provide the specific commands for each of these steps now?
