I've created a comprehensive collection of prompts that will help you complete your SonarQube setup project from start to finish. These prompts are designed to guide you through each phase of the project, helping you get the information and assistance you need.

The prompts are organized by project phase:

1. **Initial Setup** - Planning and prerequisite verification
2. **Minikube Configuration** - Optimizing your Kubernetes environment  
3. **Kubernetes Setup** - Creating namespaces and storage configurations
4. **Database Configuration** - Setting up and securing PostgreSQL
5. **SonarQube Deployment** - Deploying and configuring the main application
6. **Integration Setup** - Connecting with other tools and systems
7. **Testing & Validation** - Ensuring everything works correctly
8. **Documentation** - Creating guides for users and administrators
9. **Debugging and Troubleshooting** - Handling issues that arise
10. **Advanced Customization** - Extending SonarQube's functionality
11. **Maintenance** - Keeping the system running smoothly

Each prompt is marked to indicate:
- [+] Prompts you've already used or similar information you've received
- [-] Prompts you might need in future stages of the project

You can simply copy and paste these prompts when you need specific guidance on a particular aspect of your SonarQube setup. The prompts are designed to get you detailed, actionable responses that move your project forward.
