I've created a comprehensive to-do list for completing your SonarQube setup project in Minikube on Codespaces. The list is organized into logical sections that cover the entire project lifecycle, from initial setup to ongoing maintenance.

Each item is marked with:
- [+] for completed tasks
- [-] for tasks still to be done
- Emojis to make the list more visual and easier to scan

The list includes all the technical setup steps we've already covered, plus additional important tasks like:

- Testing and validation steps
- Documentation requirements
- Integration with CI/CD systems
- Team onboarding and training
- Ongoing maintenance procedures

This to-do list serves as both a project tracking tool and a checklist to ensure nothing important is missed during implementation. You can modify priority levels or add more specific tasks based on your project's unique requirements.
