In PowerShell, you can set environment variables either temporarily for the current session or persistently across sessions. Here's how to do both:

---

### 🔹 Temporary Environment Variables (Session-Only)
To set an environment variable that lasts only for the duration of the current PowerShell session, use the `$Env:` prefix

```powershell
$Env:MY_VAR = "MyValue"
```
To append a value to an existing environment variable (e.g., adding a directory to the `PATH`)

```powershell
$Env:PATH += ";C:\New\Path"
```
These changes are temporary and will be lost once the session ends

---

### 🔸 Persistent Environment Variables (Across Sessions)
To create environment variables that persist beyond the current session, you can use the .NET `[System.Environment]` class or the `setx` comman.

#### **Using .NET `[System.Environment]` Class**
This method allows you to set variables at the User or Machine (System) leve:

- **User Scope (applies to the current user):**

 
```powershell
  [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", "MyValue", "User")
  ``


- **Machine Scope (applies to all users; requires administrative privileges):**

 
```powershell
  [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MY_VAR", "MyValue", "Machine")
  ``

Changes made using this method take effect in new session.

#### **Using `setx` Command**
Alternatively, you can use the `setx` command to set persistent environment variable:

- **User Scope:**

 
```powershell
  setx MY_VAR "MyValue"
  ``


- **Machine Scope (requires administrative privileges):**

 
```powershell
  setx MY_VAR "MyValue" /M
  ``

Note: `setx` does not update the current session; the changes will be available in new session.

### ✅ Viewing Environment Variables
To list all environment variables in the current sessio:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Env:
``

To retrieve the value of a specific variabl:

```powershell
$Env:MY_VAR
``

